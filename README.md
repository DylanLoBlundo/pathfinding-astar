# pathfinding-astar
An implementation of A* algorithm for a robot moving on a NxN grid. The robot can only see and move to adjacent tiles.
An implementation of DFS algorithm (Depth-First-Search) has been made to move to a non-adjacent cell when the A* algorithm finds a non-adjacent cell at the head of the priority queue.
Robot finds a minimal path.
